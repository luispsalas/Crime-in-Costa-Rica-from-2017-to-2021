# Data-Analysis

With this project I intend to extend my practice in data analysis with Python, in which I make use of pandas, 
numpy, matplot en re libraries.

The sourced data set is "Crime in Costa Rica from 2017 to 2021" posted by Luis Rodolfo Valverde Delgado.

Overview
=============

This is a crime report data set by province, canton, nationality, gender, date, etc.


This is a very limited dataset without any information about prosecution. Some field names seem ambiguous and gender information is also incomplete as it only presents 'Male', Female and 'Unknown'.

Also, it would be insightful to have additional data like: type of report: phone call / online / present, 

With that said, the data shows some notable (if expected) aspects:

-A correlation between high crime report incidences and zones associated with drug trade and drug transportation. 
(Costa Rica is on route for high volume drug trading between South and North America. Interestingly the data set lacks information about drug crime reports).

-A very significant drop of reports in the greater two periods of lockdown in the country due to the Covid pandemic.
